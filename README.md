# Sorting
Project that implements several different sorting algorithms, and the means to analyze their performance


Youâ€™ve been given a scattered list of small monsters present in the Knightrola region. You need to evaluate six means of comparison-based sort to get these monsters in order.

You need to implement six sorts for the monster structure:

* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Quick sort
* Merge sort
* Merge sort, switching to insertion sort at n < 25
